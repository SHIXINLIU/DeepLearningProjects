# SGD Perceptron Nerual Network on MNIST

Built a SGD Perceptron model trained on MNIST dataset to recognize digits(0-9). 

I have to implement feed-forward layer and back-propagation by myself since not allowed to use TF yet.

## Preprocess
Just read from dataset and return NumPy array of inputs as float32 and labels as int8. 

## Train
Run `python assignment.py` or use something like Pycharm. 

## Conclusion
It takes seconds to finish training and my model's accuracy on test set is 0.9032. 

The first 10 images with their labels are chosen for visualization.
