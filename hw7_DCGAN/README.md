# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)

                 | discriminator model
                 | main func
- data/celebA   (images for training)
- output        (fake images generated by G model)
- checkpoints   (ckpts saved)
```

## Dependency
This project is run on GCP CS147 virtual environment. Besides, these packages are also required:
* tqdm
* tensorflow_gan
* tensorflow_hub
* imageio
* requests

## Preprocess
Run `python download.py` to download data. A dir `/data` is generated. 

Run `cd data; tar -xvzf celebA.tar` to unzip tha data. There're nearly 2 million celeb face images.

## Train
Run `python assignment.py` to start train again. 

Checkpoints will be stored in `/checkpoints` every 500 iterartions during the train. 

## Test
Run `python assignment.py --mode=test` to start test mode. 

Latest checkpoints will be loaded and a batch of images will be generated by G model and stored in `/output`. 

Hopefully they can be recognized as almost human faces in Picasso style! 

## Conclusion
It takes about 2 hours on GCP K80 GPU to train the model for 10 epoch.

My average FID per batch is around 170 at the end of train.
